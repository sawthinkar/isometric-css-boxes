## Animated CSS Boxes

Pure CSS Perspective Boxes (Animated) v3 - with Controls by [Joshua Hibbert](https://joshnh.com/) 

## Getting Started

• Nothing to get started here.  
• Go to [original Codepen link](https://codepen.io/joshnh/pen/FCJGI) to give kudos to Joshua and check out more of their [cool stuff](https://codepen.io/joshnh/pens/public).  
• I am just testing this code to see how it works in Github pages. I came across this while checking out [isometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_video_game_graphics) design trend.
